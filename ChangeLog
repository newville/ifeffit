2007-05-31  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>
	* Version 1.2.10:  
	- fixed rdffdt.f to read feff.dat files without being 
	  sensitive to unix / dos / mac  line endings

2006-05-26  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>
	* Version 1.2.9:  

	- added some better memory management for arrays, and
	  the variable '&heap_used', containing the fraction
	  of array heap space used. 

	- fixed reset() bug.
	
	- added warning when a user-defined 'fitting variable' is 
	  accessed as a 'global variable' by an internal command by
	  getsca('var_name').

	- added norm_order argument to spline().

2005-09-14  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>
	* Version 1.2.8:  

	- fixed configure script looking for curses/termcap libraries.

	- many changes in Windows distribution.

	- fixed bug in iff_shell.c so that it now works correctly on
          64-bit linux. Also added '-fPIC' to FFLAGS arguments in
	  Makefiles so that wrappers build on 64bit linux systems.

	- add '--with-64bit' to PGPLOT_install so that pgplot may be 
	  built on 64bit linux.

	- changed (fixed??) background refinement in feffit() to have 
	  the spline range extend over a wider k-range.


2005-04-07  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.2.7:  
	- add &status variable to hold many status flags from commands.
	  The &status variable will hold an integer:  
	     1   being a warning (including 'unknown keyword' for commands)
	     2   something caused the command to stop prematurely
	     3   a more serious error, generally including hitting an
                internal limit, but also including 'file not found'
		
          examples:
	     math syntax errors    ('a/*b')   sets &status to 2
             math evaluation erors ('log(0)') sets &status to 2
	     unknown group or no x-array in most commands  sets &status to 2

	Notes: 
	  1. &status value is NOT reset at each command (so that warnings
  	     persist through macros, for example), and need to be reset by
  	     the user. 
	  2. the &status value will never be lowered, so that the most
	     serious of &status levels is reflected.
	
	The whole &status mechanism is designed primarily for
	wrappers  where this sequence is easy enough to encapsulate: 
  	    execute command
	    check &status
	    react to &status (and maybe look at echo buffer at this point)
            reset &status to 0

	- added math function 'penalty(x,lo_val,hi_val)' which returns:
	
	     0                 for  lo_val <= x <= hi_val
	     abs(x-lo_val)     for  x < lo_val
	     abs(x-hi_val)     for  x > hi_val

        this is useful for setting a restraint on a parameter so that it
	is preferred to fall within a given range.  The penalty function
	gives a more gentle penalty than   
	    max(lo_val,min(x,hi_val))
	and is better suited for chi-square sums (and will allow
	uncertainties to be estimated).	 
	
	- fixed bug in iff_wrdata.f so that up to 99 arrays can be written
	with the write_data() command.  This value is set in consts.h as
	max_outarr and exposed as the scalar '&max_output_cols'.

        - upgraded readline library to readline 5.0	
	
2004-07-08  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.2.6: assorted bug fixes, improvements

	- fixed important bug in feffit() and ff2chi() that could end up 
          with polluted path lists. Doing a second fit in a session using 
          fewer paths would use some leftover paths. The path list is now 
          initialized properly.

	- reading of feff.inp in feff6 now uses iread() so that
          feff6 no longer fails because of line endings that don't match
          the standard for that platform.  
	
	- plot markers and arrows now support color, with 
	   plot_arrow(...,color=red)
	   plot_marker(...,color=blue)

	- location of the plot legend now more customizable using
	  one of two equivalent methods:
	    plot(...., key='data', key_x=0.9, key_y0=0.9,key_dy=0.1)
	  or setting
  	    &plot_key_x = 0.9
	    &plot_key_y0 = 0.9
	    &plot_key_dy = 0.1
	  where 'key_x' is the x-location of the legend 'key_y0' is the
          y-location of the first key, and 'key_dy' is the vertical offset
	  between keys.

2004-01-22  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.2.5: bug fixes, improved feff path lists, fixed
	problems with spline() clamps, restraints in feffit(), altered
	screen messages for autobk/feffit/feff6, and added random()
	command to generate arrays of random numbers.

	- path lists for feffit(), ff2chi(), erase(), and show() can now 
	range over undefined paths, so that 
	   feffit(1-100,...)  
	will use all *currently defined* paths between 1 and 100
	(inclusive), even if only paths 2, 8, and 55 are defined.  Here
	are some related changes: 

	  o path indices are strictly checked to be in the range 1..9999.

	  o since the maximum path index is 9999, the list '1-9999' means
	    'all defined paths'.  This can be abbreviated as 'all', as in:
  	        ff2chi(all,group=ff)
	    which will sum all curently defined paths. 

	  o erase(@paths) and erase(@path=all) are now equivalent, both 
	    erasing all defined paths. 
   
	  o when erasing a path, the feff data associated with a path will
	    be freed (if it's not in use by another path) so that new feff
	    paths can be used.

	  o the formatting of the output of 'show @path' and 'show @paths'
	    has changed.  R is now reported (not just reff and delr), each
	    parameter is listed on its own line, and the path parameters 
	    3rd, 4th, ei, and dphase are reported only if defined.

	
	- added random() command, to generate an array of random numbers,
	using uniform, gaussian, or normal distributions.  syntax is:
	    random(output=my.random, npts=200, dist=normal, sigma=2.)

	where sigma will be (approximately) the standard deviation of the
	normal and gaussian distributions, or the scale of the uniform
	distribution. Sigma is 1 unless explicitly set. You can optionally
	reset the seed of the random number generator with the seed
	keyword.  The gaussian and normal distribution appear very
	similar, and can both be used to simulate noise in data.
	
	- chi_noise() now generates 'kmax_suggest', an estimate of the
	maximum usable k-value for the data, based on the estimated noise
	in the data.  In early tests, this appears to be a reasonable
	estimate for 'noisy data', and a bit pessimistic for clean data.
	Please use this value as a guide.

	- clamps in spline() now try to bring chi() to zero at kmax/emax
	and kmin/emin instead af last and first data point.

	- an error in feffit() for how multiple restraints were applied
	has been fixed. multiple restraints can now be applied and mixed
	freely with multiple k-weights and multiple data sets.

	- improved screen messages printed by autobk/feffit/feff6:
	  o replaced all print* statements with 'call echo()'
	  o messages 'echo'ed to the screen are now 'tee'd to the
	    run files autobk/feffit/feff6.run
	  o replace all 'stop' statements with a 'call echo()' and 
	    the creation of an error file autobk/feffit/feff6.err.
	    If this file exists after a run of autobk/feffit/feff6,
	    then an error did occur; after successful runs, the error
	    file will not exist.
	   
	
2003-10-28  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>, with Charlotte's help

	* Version 1.2.4: a long list of bug fixes, increases in limits,
	  and other improvements

	- n_varys now correctly reported by feffit()

	- increased many limits on string sizes, now generally 256
	  characters for most internal strings and for text variables.

	- increased number of paths to 256 and feff files to 512, and 
	  eliminated the distinction between 'total number of paths' 
	  and 'total number of paths for a particular data set'.

	- added program variables &n_guess, &n_scalars, &n_arrays,
	  &n_scalars_set, &n_scalars_def, &n_arrays_set, &n_arrays_def,
	  and &n_strings that contain the number of each kind of variable
	  currently in use, and the variables &max_scalars, &max_arrays,
	  &max_strings, &max_paths, &max_varys, and &max_data_sets to
	  contain the maximun number of each of these kinds of data.
	
	- added show @limits to show all the '&n_*' and '&max_*' variables
	  above plus current memory limits in &maxpts and &heap_free.
	  
	- changed autobk, feffit, and feff6 to take command-line argument
	  for input file:
	    autobk my_inpfile.inp
	  and so on.  autobk and feffit name their log according to the
	  input file name.
	  
	- fixed annoying bug that ignored entire lines that included an
	  EOF character, which might (on many unixes) be a valid last line
	  of a file.

	- rewrote handling of repeated x-values when automatically sorting
          data. Previously, data points with x(i) == x(i+1) were attempted
	  to be averaged.  Now, the value of x(i+1) is increased slightly
	  (typically 1% of x(i+2)-x(i)). This fixed odd behaviour of
	  spline() when handed strangely ordered data by athena.

	- amended $column_label output of read_data() to be able to handle
	  column labels longer than a single string can hold (256
	  characters, currently).  The scalar ncolumn_label now holds the 
	  number of text strings used.   The first string is held in 
	  both $column_label and $column_label1.  Additional text strings 
	  of $column_label2, ..., $column_label9 are used, as needed.

	- added provisional f1->f2 capabilities to diffkk.  This passes a
	  very simple test, but is not very well-tested at this point, and 
	  may require some tweaks.  Consider it a test version, and report
	  problems!
	
2003-09-15  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

	* Version 1.2.3: bug fixes

	- setting path_index now correctly makes the selected
	  path 'the current path', and causes re-evaluation of
          defined variables and path parameters according to 
	  that path's values for reff, degen, etc.

	- fixed error with spline() not passing pre1,pre2 to
	  pre_edge() correctly.
	
2003-08-21  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

	* Version 1.2.2: bug fixes, build improvements

	bugs:
	- fixed error with k-space feffit() fitting so that 
          k-weighting is now really used!!

	- fixed error with using reff in defined math expressions

	- increased size of math expressions to 256 operations/values.

	- changed restraint mechanism to work slightly better with 
	  multiple data	sets

	- fixed error in read_data() that allowed core-dumps when 
	  reading files larger than the maximum array size.

	build improvements:

	- switched configure to use autoconf 2.53, including 'newer'
	  automated searches for fortran libraries, setting default f77
	  compiler to g77, which should help builds on Mac OS X.
	
	- removed fortran subdirectory -- an existing, working fortran 
	  compiler is needed to build ifeffit.
	
	- fixed iconf_pgplot to check that PGPLOT directories listed
	  in the PGPLOT make really exist (and are directories) before
	  including them in the link arguments.

        - upgraded to readline 4.3

        - upgraded python installation to use Pmw 1.1
		
2003-05-19  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

	* Version 1.2.1: bug fixes:

	- precision error in feff6/rdinp.f prevented the
	  pathfinder from working (completely MN's fault 
	  -- not original to feff6!!!)

	- fixed bug in writing output fit arrays in feffit()
	  for multiple-k-weight fits, and with do_bkg=true.

	- slightly outdated Ifeffit.py had been included in 
	  1.2.0, only noticed when building the Windows version.

2003-05-14  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.2.0: declared this version as the first 
	'stable' version of the 1.2 series, 

	bug fixes since 1.0077:

	- extraneous print statements in iff_set.f removed.
	- background function '*.kbkg' was not correctly computed 
	for output in feffit()
	
2003-04-30  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0077: several changes and improvements, ranging
	from bug fixes to significant enhancements:
	
	- plot() now interprets 'key=""' correctly to mean to not show a
	legend key.

	- plot(reset) now works, resetting the color and style tables to
	the original values.

	- read_data() no longer automatically sorts on the first column
	(or any other column) by default, but rather leaves data as read
	unless explicitly sorted.

	- fixed incorrect reporting of a parsing non-error (and some
	related mistakes) on several math expression idioms involving
	nested multi-argument functions, as in this deglitching gem, which
	now works as expected to remove the data point closest to x=badx:
	  new.x = join(slice(old.x,1,badx-1),slice(old.x,badx+1,npts(old.x)))
	  new.y = join(slice(old.y,1,badx-1),slice(old.y,badx+1,npts(old.y)))
	
	- spline() and bkg_cl() now uses a new rebinning/interpolation
	algorithm to convert data from chi(E) to chi(k).  For
	finely-spaced energy data such as from QEXAFS measurements, this
	algorithm averages over all energy points within the corresponding
	k range, given by [k-kgrid/2k,k+kgrid/2).  Where no points lie
	within the k-range, a 3-point interpolation using the closest
	points is used.  The 'interp' keyword to spline() and bkg_cl()
	have been deprecated and are silently ignored.
	
	- The rebin() function (which works like other interpolation
	functions) now uses this rebinning/averaging algorithm as well.

	- f1f2() now looks up and uses the 'known core-width of an edge'
	by default.  That is, if the atom given has an edge energy in the
	supplied energy range, the corresponding core-width is used.

	- Other minor improvements were made to f1f2(), and especially in
	the lorenztian convolution so that it works more reliably for
	large, uneven arrays.

	- Cromer-Libermann data updated to have slightly more significant
	digits, which seems to be important to avoid 'weird points', which
	often showed up exacly at absorption edges.
	
	- feffit() and minimize() now list 'bad variables' after a fit for
	which error bars could not be estimated.

	- feffit() now produces correct chi(R) data when input chi(k) data
	is not on a k=0.05Ang^-1 grid.

	- feffit(bkg=true) now works with multiple-data-set fits.
	
	- feffit() now "correctly" sums the number of independent points
	for multiple-data sets as the sum of independent points in each
	data set.  There is also a minimal checks whether the chi(k) data
	is repeated in a single fit (check== is the name the same or is
	the sum of squares of chi(k) over the fit k-range the same?).
	
	- feffit() now supports multiple-k-weights, with syntax
    	    feffit(..., kweight=2, kweight=0, kweight=4,...)

	which will use _all_ these k-weights (up to 5 allowed).  For
	simple implementations of multiple-data-set fits on the same
	dataset with only the kweight being different, the gives
	numerically equivalent results.  Important caveats are that the
	repored error bars _always_ reflect the fact that only 1 data set
	is really is used, and that the rest of the k- and r-range
	parameters are forced to be uniform.  There may be some subtle
	differences when using other fitting add-ons, such as 'bkg=true'
	(ie, only one bkg function will be used) or restraints.  Output
	arrays generated for this form of multiple-k-weight fits will use
	the FIRST kweight listed.
	
2003-01-21  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0076: several changes and improvements over the past months

	fixed plotting bug in which all legends were not always shown, 
	especially when making hard copies

	added 'unguess' command which simply converts all 'guess'ed 
	variables to 'set' values.  No arguments, no options.

	added 'window' command to generate an FT window without actually
	doing the FT.  requires an x array, but otherwise acts very much 
	like fftf().
	
	fixed bug in reading 1-row data files.  The results are now
	converted to scalars, with names of the form $group_prefix
	
        allow (consistently) '&', ':', and '?' in variable and group
	names.
	
        added math functions for array manipulations:
          x   = nofx(m.a,x0)     index of m.a with value closest to x0
          m.x = join(m.a,m.b)    concatenate 2 arrays
          m.x = slice(m.a,x0,x1) sub-array m.a[x0:x1], using fortran
                                 array conventions (first element is 1).

	many further tweaks to configuration procedure: 
	  - the shell script iconf_iff now automatically builds 
	    src/lib/sys.h and src/lib/maxpts.h at configure time. 
	  - the shell script iconf_flib	now fixes the poorly sorted
	    FLIBS on most Linux systems, that caused some problems with
	    perl's MakeMaker
	  - there is now a 'configure; make' procedure in src/macosx,
	    with 'configure' now building a Makefile (which still might
	    need tweaking). This uses 'uname -s' for setting
	    darwin-specific code.  Aside from GNU Readline issues, this
	    build procedure should work on many Unix systems.


2002-11-12  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0075a: tweaked build procedure so that all
	system-specific stuff is put into src/lib/sys.h, which is
	built by the shell script iff_config.  

	The MacOS X directory (src/macosx) now has its own version of this
	script, and should now work. 

2002-11-01  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0075: switched wrapper generation to swig1.3,
	so that perl extension works with gcc3.2 (as on RedHat Linux 8.0)
	The Tcl extension has not been updated.

	added feff6 to source distribution

	reworked meaning of 'erase @path' to only set path parameters
	to '', and not destroy corresponding feff data, as this could
	trash other paths.
	
	tweaked build procedure a little.
	
	
2002-09-18  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0074: fixed bug in FFTs with phase-correction.

	fixed bug in reporting of path parameters that values of sigma2
	depending on debye() and eins() functions were not always shown
	to be updated.

	fixed bug in feffit (now version 2.98) in which parameters
	depending on debye(t,th) or eins(t,th) were not always updated 
	correctly when t and th were literal constants.  This
	especially affected non-fits.

2002-08-16  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0073: added 'interpolation options' to spline()
	and bkg_cl(), with syntax 'interp=line', 'interp=quad', or
	'interp=cubic' to change the final interpolation scheme for
	converting data from chi(E) to chi(k)

	The k-grid spacing (previously set at 0.05Ang-1) can now be
	set as a build time option in config.h with the parameter
	'qgrid'.  This and the length of the FFT arrays may
	eventually become run-time parameters. Changing these values
	should be considered as highly experimental.

	changed default arraysize to 'medium' (ie, 4096 elements).
	
	fixed bug in call to 'coth' math function.

	improved Grwin/PGPLOT on Windows to auto-raise the plotting
	window on all plot, cursor, and zoom commands.
	
	improvements to GIFEFFIT.
	
2002-06-24  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0072: rewrote macro execution routine to remove 
	the use of recursion, which was causing nested macros to
	not work correctly on windows. 
	
        - some major changes to configuration and build procedure,
	especially in that perl and python wrappers are no longer built
	during 'configure; make', but must be made separately, and after
	installation.

	- added a &heap_free variable, which contains the number of
	available array elements.  When this gets lower than the maximum
	array length (typically 8192), bad things can start to happen.
	Normally, &heap_free starts at 2**21 ~= 2million array elements.

	- fixed some errors in 'erase()' so that now the constants pi and
	etok cannot be erased, and 'erase @scalars' does not erase system
	variables (ie, '&*').  Also sped up execution times for 
	'erase @arrays'  and '@groups'.
	
	
2002-04-02  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0071: changed configuration and some plotting
	behavior, updated documentation

	- PGPLOT_install will now install the PNG driver unless explicitly 
	told to (with --no-png).  Similarly, the GIF driver can be turned
	off with --no-gif.

	- configure was changed to check which PGPLOT drivers are used and
	to build the list of libraries to link with explicitly.  This runs
	the shell script ./test_pgplot to spit out the 'link libraries'
	for PGPLOT.  It is not extensively tested across unixes.
	Specifically, it works with PGPLOT_install and with pre-built
	PGPLOT lib on Mac OS X.

	configure also now runs on Mac OS X, though the returned value for
	FLIBS seems bad.  To fix this,
	      ./configure --prefix=/sw
	      make FLIBS='-lg2c'
	is necessary.  This builds the C, and fortran libs and apps, but
	the extensions seem to need to be built after the installation of
	the main library.  This is still under investigation -- for now,
	the build in src/macosx also works. 
	
	- the ifeffit variable $plot_devices now contains a list of all 
	available plotting devices for the installation.

	- error bars can be included in a plot: 
	     plot( dat.x, dat.y, dy=dat.dy)

        where dat.dy is the uncertainty in dat.y.  Error bars in x:
	'dx=dat.dx' is also supported.

	- the plot command now supports a 'one array' version:
             plot (dat.z)
	which will plot dat.z as the y- array against the _previous_
	x-array, or against an dummy array of (1,2,..) if it is the 
	first plot in a series.	 That is, 
 	     plot energy,xmu, group='data'
	     plot bkg

	now does what you would expect:
 	     plot (data.energy, data.xmu)
 	     plot (data.energy, data.bkg)
	

2002-03-05  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0070: feffit 2.97 now appears to work completely
	and is included in build and installation.  Like autobk, this
	is a 'transitional version' between the classic version and
	a full 'ifeffit application', and keeping the outward appearance
	of the 'classic version' and using the ifeffit libraries only
	for the low-level numeric stuff. Feffit currently uses its own
	version of 'the math parser' as well. 

	- added special functions to make the generation of gaussian,
	lorentzian, and pseudo-voight lineshapes easier:
	    my.y = gauss(my.x, centroid, sigma)
	    my.y = loren(my.x, centroid, sigma)
	    my.y = pvoight(my.x, centroid, fwhm,eta)
	
	see documentation (soon to be updated!).
	
	- added 'group' keyword to save to give a specified group to 
	include in the save file. If used, all groups must be listed:
	   save(group=data,group=fit,...)
	
	- fixed zoom(show) to work again.
	
	- minor updates to gifeffit.
	
2002-02-18  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0069: added feff tables, made several 
	changes to aid portability to Win32 and MacOS X(!), 

	- included fefftab directory of Feff Tables.  Currently
	these are only read by internal routines, and cannot 
	(yet) be manipulated in the main interpreter.

	- provisional (ie, not very well tested) support for
	phase-corrected Fourier Transforms using feff tables.
	    fftf(xx.chi, pc_edge = 'Ni K')
	for example.

	- added 'force_read' keyword to path() to force the 
	re-reading of a feffNNNN.dat file (in case it may have
	changed	since it was last read).
		
	- improved behavior of load() command for files and/or
	directories with spaces in their names (use quotes!!),
	and force surrounding quotes on startup file (for Win32 
	startup file of C:\Program Files\ifeffit\startup.iff)
	  
	- addded 'macosx' directory and Makefile to build for
	MacOS X while avoiding 'configure;make'.  This relies 
	heavily on installin of Fink tools for MacOS X. See 
	README.MACOSX and src/macosx/README for details.
	
	Build instructions are effectively reduced to 
	  'cd src/macosx; view Makefile; make'

	This Makefile might actually be a useful starting point
	for other Unix and Unix-like systems that have some Unix
	tools in place but does not 'configure' correctly.
	
	- tweaked iff_shell.c to better link against a known 
	installation of readline 4.2 (for MacOS X).  Enough linux
	distributions still distribute 2.2 that it's just easier
	to always build a known version under 'normal build'.	

	- feffit is now included in the build tree (src/feffit),
	compiles as fully double precision, and uses some of the 
	routines in src/lib/.  But this version of feffit is still
	SEVERELY BROKEN at the moment.  Please don't use it and 
	complain about it!!
	

2002-02-07  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0068: bug fixes

	- fixed severe parse error for expressions containing min() 
	and max() functions.

	- fixed error (yet another!) in setting of path degeneracy.
	Really, this should work now.
	

2002-01-27  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0067: several additions

	- changed cursor / zoom routines from pgplot's pgcurs to pgband,
	showing 'zoom box' on zoom, and allowing vertical lines or 
	cross-hairs for cursor selection.  Seems to not work on Win32.

	- added additional plotting commands: plot_marker(), plot_text(),
	plot_arrow(), each of which draw to the plot window:
	   plot_text(x,y, text_string)
	which is equivalent to
	   plot (text_x=x, text_y=y, text=text_string)

	   plot_marker(x,y, marker_number)
        arrows can have adjustable size, barb fraction, and angle of
	arrowhead, or no head at all:
	   plot_arrow(x1,y1,x2,y2, size=3, barb=0.4, angle=45)
	   plot_arrow(x1,y1,x2,y2, no_head)

	- added storage of and access to the central-atom phase-shift for
	a feff path.  The command get_path() will now generate arrays for
	k, amp, phase, lambda and cphase with the 'do_arrays' keyword.

	- fftf() phase-corrected FTs now use a specified feff path, and
	either the full phase-shift or central-atom phase-shift:
	   fftf(...., pc_path = path_index, pc_caps / pc_full )
	
	- added 'sort' keyword to read_data to sort the data so that a 
	selected column (by column number only) is monotonically 
	increasing.

	- improved spline() and pre_edge() handling of unsorted data
	(sorting it internally) and for data in keV.

2002-01-07  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0066: bug fixes

	more complete enforcement of '&maxpts' internally.  Now 
	writing 'maxpts.h' at configure time and using as an 
	include file for almost all array size definitions. 
	
	switched python module from using compile.py to using 
	distutils for build process.
		
	changed return of the C library function iff_scaval from *double
	to a plain double.   ifftest2.c changed accordingly.

	changed rule for determining comment lines in data files from "a
	comment character in the first character on a line" to "a comment
	character in the first non-blank and non-tab character on a line".
	comment characters can be '#%;' or a user-defined character. 
	
2002-01-01  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0065: provisional fixing of multiple bugs and annoyances:

	added '&maxpts' internal scalar to give maximum array size.  This
	can now be used by perl/python modules to generate arrays.

	fixed severe bug in Ifeffit.pm causing get_scalar to not work
	(exit status of C's get_scalar had changed to 0 for success). 

	fixed errors in ifftest2.c, and in iff_scaval()
	
	added initialization string to perl/python modules so that the
	interpreter is ensured to be initialized when loaded.

	improved the auto-scaling of the optional standard used in
	spline() -- it was essentially hardwired previously.  Also added 
	a keyword for 'r1st' -- distance beyond rbkg for first-shell
	amplitude matching. Added simple examples for using standard in
	spline() and for using end-point clamps.

	moved this ChangeLog back to root directory, altered BuildBuild to 
	use it from root position for library build.

	updated athena version to 

	removed plotting from diffkk executable, so that it can compile
	simply under --with-f2c compile option.	
	
2001-10-17  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0064: provisional (tested, but not completely) support
        for multiple-data-set fitting in feffit(). This appears easier 
	than I originally thought, and more useful than trying to support
	a hybrid stand-alone feffit.  Fixed lots of little problems 
	with path definitions along the way.	
		
	diffkk() command still incomplete 
	
2001-10-05  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0063: preliminary support for diffkk standalone
	(unstable but can be made to work) and for dkk() function in
	math parser (the diffkk command inside ifeffit proper is not 
	yet working right).

	fixed a few bugs, including 'show @paths' possibly showing
	the wrong reff/degen values.

	several updates to reference doc

	improved _fortran_ interface with ifeffit.inc file.
	
2001-09-07  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0062: several minor changes, mostly to improve
	documentation and python interface.

	updated athena version to B Ravel's latest.

	added provisional inclusion of diffkk into the ifeffit build
	system (working, poorly tested -- no plotting as of yet).

2001-07-09  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0061: added B Ravel's athena perl GUI program, 
	fixed bug in handling screen echo with log files.

2001-07-06  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	
	
        * Version 1.0060: improved C interface, adding functions
	iff_strval() and iff_scaval() to return pointers to ifeffit
	strings and scalars.  Also, now allowing '#' characters in
	iff_put_string() calls. 
	
	improved lorenztian and gaussian convolution functions
	to allow non-evenly spaced data to be properly convolved.

	turned off default startup message from library -- now
	assumed to be handled by calling program

	eliminated need for PGPLOT_DEV environmental variable, by
	defaulting to the '/xserve' persistent window and to '/gw'
	for Win32 systems.

	added  --with-arraysize=[tiny, small, medium, large] to 
	configure for customizing the maximum array size (which 
	dominates the amount of memory required).  The default is
	'medium', which allows arrays of up to 8192 elements, and 
	uses around ~16Mb of RAM for a typical 'spline()' and ~22Mb 
	for a typical 'feffit()' execution.  For now, I consider this 
	to be much more efficient than necessary.
		
2001-06-08  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0059: added options for different sizes for
	different plot quantities (labels, markers, on-panel
	text). 

	
2001-06-05  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0058:  fixed deep, weird parse error
	essentially rewrote subroutine bkeys() to be somewhat
	more sensible at dealing with nested parens and quotes.

	print now treats '...' and "..." differently: "..."
	will evaluate the enclosed string, '...' will not.  No
	other commands are affected by this change.
	
	added 'key' keyword to plot() which gives a primitive 
	gnuplot-like legend.
	
	worked on reference manual some.

	added '.norm' output to spline(), which was redefining
	edge_step after a pre_edgg() call, but not updating the
	'.norm' array.

	
2001-06-01  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

        * Version 1.0057:  several bug fixes and changes, including:

	updated PAD library to avoid sign errors on crays, and to
	be in sync with version used in Feff

	updated use of restraints in feffit(), added keywords
	restraint (and restraint_01 through restraint_09). Not fully
	tested or documented, but appears to work in test cases.

	added command 'bkg_cl()' to do pre-edge subtraction, and
	normalization based on fit of data to Cromer-Libermann data.
	Not fully tested or documented, but appears to work.

	upgraded to GNU Readline4.2, made several improvements
	in build system for non-linux Unix systems.

	still puzzling over bug report for improper path parameter
	values (based on old definitions?)

2001-04-13  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

	* Version 1.0056:  debye bugfix, win32 update.

	fixed several related bugs associated with debye(), eins(),
	and 'path_index' that were preventing debye() and eins()
	to be correctly evaluated at all times. 'path_index'
	stores user-chosen path index for a path, and is used by many
	internal functions and commands, including debye() and eins(). 

	switched Win32 to GrWin 0.997, which now builds and runs
	correctly, and fixes problems with cursor()/zoom() so that 
	these now work on Win32.

        Makefile is now generating installation location for gifeffit, 
	instead of relying on a hardwired /usr/local/bin.
	
2001-04-11  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

	* Version 1.0055: 

	fixed several bugs discovered by building Win32 DLL, 
	mostly due to array-bounds.  Win32 DLL and command-line
	program are both now working again.

	vastly improved mechanism to add an additional scalar
	value to function-to-minimize in feffit/minimize.
	
2001-03-25  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>	

	* Version 1.0054: bug fixes, improved build system
	
	fixed bug in minimize() that broke many fits.

	fixed bug recently added to write_data() that
	prevented 'string globs' ('$title_*') from working

	fixed 'TERMLIB' setting for linking against readline.

	reworked building of perl Makefile.PL, now using 
	ExtUtils::F77 (included with distribution).

	added --enable-python, --enable-perl, --enable-tcl, 
	and --enable-all switches to configure to automate the 
	building of the optional wrappers for these interpreted 
	languages.   All are enabled by default. So farw this 
	works, but there are still a few issues to work out: 
	(support for python2.0, some hardwired install 
	directories, untest for old installations, and no
	installation directory of tcl extension).
	
2001-03-22  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0053: added range() function  in math parser
	my.x = range(0.0, 1.0, 0.05) 

	now creates an array of 21 elements: 0.0, 0.05, ..., 1.00

	   range(start,stop,step)

	array will go up to but  not exceed the value stop:
	   range(1,2.2, 0.5)  -> 1.0, 1.5, 2.0
	step can be negative, but it is an error for it to be zero.

	minor fixes to script configurations and PGPLOT_install, 
	tweaks of Ifeffit.pm.

2001-03-10  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0052: misc fixes (working on tutorial)

	improved behavior of 'print' so that it doesn't 
	chokes on unparenthesized lists.  improved behavior
	of 'show' so that output is better aligned.
	
	fixed bug preventing k-space feffit() from working

	fixed bug in fft due to unitialized array data,
	(seemed to only show up when mixing fftf and fftr),
	set default limit of output for q-space data to 30Ang^-1.
	
	added support for scalars to write_data(), so that 
	scalar names and values are written to header lines.
	
	worked on tutorial to point of calling it a completed
	first draft.
	
2001-02-27  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0051: fixed minor bugs:

	1. save files got broken in 1.0050: fixed.
	2. one column data files can now be read.
	3. added log10() function.
	4. improved initialization of pre-edge/normalization routine.

2001-02-26  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0050: fixed several bugs in implementation and
	manipulation of single flat array structure for program data,
	after a good bit (but not exhaustive) testing.

	Arrays can now have up to 16384 elements in length, and smaller
	arrays only use up as much room as they need (well maybe with a
	little padding).  Erasure of arrays and re-defining arrays (the
	tricky parts, for sure) seem to working fine, after a few days of
	testing.    

	Slight change in behavior for 'erased arrays': if an array is
	defined to depend soley on another array, and that dependency 
	is erased, the dependent array will now be erased as well (since 
	it's size is now 1: all 1-element arrays are now erased).
	That is
	   a.x = indarr(1000)
	   a.y = sin(a.x/20)
	   erase a.x
	will also cause a.y to be erased.  Note that 
	   a.z = sin((a.x + b.x)/30)
	will not be erased -- it still depends on the living b.x.	

	add &sync_level to control how often sync() is called behind 
	the scenes == still experimental and not fully implemented, but
	with the larger array sizes, repeated definitions of arrays
	can be notably slow.

	allow 'load save_file' to work as expected (that is to restore 
	the file) -- this allows save_files to be specified on the
	command line list of files to load at start up:
	   ~> ifeffit data.sav process.iff
	
2001-02-22  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0049: non-release version, converted to a single
	flat array / linked-list structure for program array data.
	This is partially tested, but seems to work well, and allows
	arrays up to 16384 elements.   Not well-tested for complex
	dependencies (with lots of sync() calls) or numerous arrays, 
	for a full buffer (2**20 doubles in all of arrays).

	added src/test directory with test programs in Fortran and C
	src/test/ifftest1  (Fortran) and src/test/ifftest2  (C)
	

2001-02-20  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0048: altered read_data to use a temporary
	buffer and then set program arrays from this.  This allows
	the number of arrays read in to be different than the number 
	of arrays on a single line, which is useful for large data 
	sets or much of the data in the Lytle database.  
	 
	  read_data(file=file, narrays=2)

	will force two arrays to be filled, even if each line contains
	8 columns:
          x y x y x y x y
	  x y x y x y x y

	
2001-02-20  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0047: fixed several minor problems, 
	especially determination of path list of feffit/ff2chi
	and feffit()'s auto-execution of chi_noise()
	
	added no_header keyword to write_data() to suppress all
	title lines.	

2001-02-19  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0046: moving steadily towards internal
	rearrangement of array data to allow arbitrary length
	arrays, moved nearly all array access in iff_* commands 
	to function calls, changing many of the routines in 
	misc_arr.f

	re-implemented use of CVS (and now checked-in properly!)

	partial (incomplete) rearrangement of examples/
	several minor code tweaks.
	
2001-02-12  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0045: fixed bug in call of chi_noise

	fixed bug in isnum() incorrectly evaluating some 
	expressions as numerical constants.

	fixed bug in minimize() (genfun.f) recently introduced
	that killed minimization of data that did not have 
	estimated uncertainties included
	
2001-01-29  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0044: some progress on improving 
	array layout and implementation

	tested (and several buglets fixed) portability of 
	build to Solaris and Alpha (with f2c), neither 
	using PGPLOT yet.  Also worked on improving the
	PGPLOT_install script as well.

2001-01-27  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0043: several minor changes to installation,
	configuration and scripting front-ends.   Most notably,
	PGPLOT_install greatly expanded.

	changed ifeffit() startup behavior to be able to
	completely suppress screen echo's, even of copyright 
	notice, by giving initial call as ifeffit('&quiet').
	
2000-12-12  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0042: fixed bug in iff_fft code of
	unitialiazed arrays that could, under certain 
	circumstances, give bad results.

	add '&pause_ignore' system variable for whether to 
	ignore pause statements -- the '-x' command-line 
	switch in the ifeffit shell now uses this.

	improved support and compatiblity with stand-alone 
	autobk code (autobk version 2.92).
	
2000-12-08  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0041: put environmental variables for history 
	file and size properly into shell command file.  

	Improved several base-installation instruction files.

	Expanded and organized macros and examples in examples/
	directory.

	fixed serious bug in arrays.h (tmparr dimensioned wrong).
	
	
2000-12-07  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0040: fixed bug in spline() preventing reliable
	user setting of e0
	- fixed bug in autobk's call to pre_edge
	- made tmparr() a global variable in arrays.h
	- added check for ncurses,termlib, etc in configuration
	
2000-10-27  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0039: reworked startup and share directory
          $(prefix)/share/ifeffit/
	so that the core interpreter loads
             $(prefix)/share/ifeffit/startup.iff
	and 
             $HOME/.ifeffit
	itself on startup (if they exist).  This improves 
	flexibility of configuration and consistency between 
	different uses of ifeffit.

	- added 'width' keyword to f1f2() command, and added 
        convolve() function to math engine for convolution with
	a lorenztian.
	
	- made python module class based so that it can initiate 
	the core interpreter, thereby avoiding the bug of calling
	put_arr() or put_scalar() before ifeffit() has been
	initialized.

	- put earlier checks on the use of trivial constants
	in set/guess/define and iff_eval, to avoid filling 
	the math engine's constant buffer 
	
	- added splint() function to math engine for natural 
	cubic spline interpolation.  Should  probably adjust
	fefinp and chipth to use cubic spline interpolation of
	feff data, but not implemented yet.
	
2000-10-22  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0038: added cromer-libermann calculations of f', f''

	-command f1f2() calculates f'(e) and f''(e) given an atomic
	number and an array of energies.  The calculation uses small 
	data files of the Cromer-Libermann parameters (not interpolation
	tables).  The data files (in src/cldata) are installed to 
             $(prefix)/share/ifeffit/cldata 
	 and are read from the installed disk location by f1f2() for 
	 use in the calculation.  The CL method is borrowed from 
         Cowan/Brennan's version, but altered significantly.

2000-10-15  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0037: macro execution for each fitting loop

	-feffit and minimize now supports a 'macro' argument
	which names a user-defined macro to execute at the end of each 
	fitting iteration.  This allows the progress of the fit to be 
	monitored by printing the current values of the variables or 
	by plotting some part of data/fit.
	

2000-10-12  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0036: improved logging capabilities, correl()
	
	-log() command now opens/closes a log file to which
	all echos can be sent:
	    log(file = log_file)  to open log file
	    ....                  all screen echos go to file
	    log(close)            to close log file

	with option:
	    screen_echo = 0,1,2,3, 'tee', 'both', 'file'
	to set the value of &screen_echo:
	    0  save to echo buffer (for get_echo() from scripts)
	    1  normal write to screen
	    2  write to log file, not screen
	    3  write to log file and screen

	-correl() command turns elements of the fit correlation 
	matrix into scalars:
	    correl(x,y,out=correl_x_y)
	where the first 2 arguments are the names of fitting 
	variables and the third argument is the name of the scalar
	to create holding this value (with default name correl_x_y)

	-added 'norm_order' keyword to pre_edge() to set order of
	polynomial for normalization constant.
	
2000-10-10  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0035: several minor fixes:
	-gifeffit -- several tweaks, mostly about failing
	to properly load and execute command files with blank lines. 
	
	-fixed BuildBuild to allow extra ":" on Version line (as above!)
	
	-fixed iff_show to show variable type for unfound variables

	-improved some warning messages

	-replaced repeated calls to lintrp() in chipth()  with 
	 explicit call to hunt() and linear interpolation

	-first working implementation of 'do_bkg=true' in command 
         feffit() to fit 'additional background'.
	
	 	
2000-10-03  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0034: fixed debye() and eins() to work correctly
	with both scalar and array contexts -- both use the concept
	of 'current path' from program variable 'path_index'.
	
	- fixed 'show  @paths' and 'show @path=N' to always (??)
	show the real path information
	
2000-10-03  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0033: added erf(), erfc() and erfcx(), 
	loggamma() special functions to math parser, and 
	revised implementation of gamma() to be more 
	consistent with other intrinsic functions. 
	
        - improved exit behavior: retracted message from 
	'quit', made iff_load a function returning 1 immediately 
	upon seeing 'quit' or 'exit' in a script, and improved
	command-line program to honor such exits in scripts 
	either loaded from the ifeffit prompt or named as a 
	command-line argument.  That is, a 'quit' or an 'exit'
	in a script will always truly exit the library and the 
	command-line program, and return 1 to a calling program.

	- encapsulated most [rdffdt not done yet] read() calls
                read(lun,...) line
	for reading from files calls with a call to function 
	iread() that returns line length and includes a call to 
	sclean to clean line-ending problems (dos/unix/mac) and 
        other C v. fortran read problems.
	
2000-09-16  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0032:  added get_path() command for a 
	simple conversion of path data to Program Variables. 
	Not yet complete.

2000-09-16  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>
	* Version 1.0031:  added gamma function to math expressions.
	also delayed putting up plot window until the first plot()
	command.  altered 'quit' to print exit message.  Other:

	- updated python installation to auto-install Pmw if needed

	- updated command-line ifeffit to accept '!ls' as a valid
	  shell escape, and to invoke a bash shell on a bare '!'.
	
2000-09-11  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0030:  added initialization of nerstp to 
	iff_minimize and added maximum loop-count to fiterr to
	avoid infinite-loop bug in minimize().
	

2000-09-10  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0029:  changed iff_plot to use pgopen/pgslct
	  and no longer pgbeg/pgend.   'new' plots are now handled very
	  differently.  This has several consequences --  most notably
	  faster plotting.   The default-interactive-device (read from
	  PGPLOT_DEV) is assumed to be the normal plotting device, and 
	  any other device makes a single hardcopy (gif, ps, ...) of
	  the current plot with a single 'plot' command.   The hardcopy
	  file is closed immediately, and the default plot is 
	  automatically reselected. 
	  
	  There is no longer a need to re-select the '/XSERVE' device. 

	  This also means that plotting works correctly on Win32 systems  
	  using the GrWin graphics libraray, at least with Cygwin 
	  (see README.CYGWIN for details).  Testing of making an
	  executable with DVF and linking as a Win32 library is still
	  underway.   

2000-09-07  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0028:  several minor fixes
	     iff_show // macro show fixed small core-dump bug
	     added 'show @macro=full' to list full macros

	     added commmand log() which is show() with one
	     pre-argument (optional keyword = 'file') of a file 
	     name to write results to:
      	      log(file= Macros.iff, @macros=full)
	  
	     will write all macros to Macros.iff
	

	     changed fiterr/gaussj call to try to stave off
	     a bug pre-report.
	

2000-09-05  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0027: altered subroutine preedg() to pass back
	coefficients of post-edge normalization curve.  the pre_edge(),
	now saves thses to 'norm_c0, norm_c1, norm_c2', so that 
	the curve can be reconstructed as:
	 data.norm_curve =   norm_c0 + norm_c1 * data.energy
	                   + norm_c2 * data.energy^2
			   
        autobk: (version 292a now)  now writes these coefficients
	out to autobk.log.

	ifeffit (version 1.0a): several improvements to this
	command-line program (This is the C/ReadLine version that 
	is auto-installed):
	   better support for tab-completion
           command history (including between sessions)
           startup file ($HOME/.ifeffit:  ifeffit commands loaded
	                   before anything else)
           command line arguments:  
	      files listed are 'load'ed as command files
	      -x option means 'execute and exit'
	   help more complete (though still not complete enough!)	
	 
2000-09-02  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0026: fixed bug in iff_save -- crashed on
	restore of a non-existent file.

2000-08-30  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0025: fixed bug in iff_rddata -- data files with
	more that 2048 points were causing severe errors. No truncate
	data -- should work on array() as a pointer-driven array.
	
	
2000-08-24  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0024: fixed bug in fefinp that made defining 
	a path with a non-existent feff.dat file cause _no_ feff
	files from ever being read in.
	
2000-08-23  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0023: add sorting of energy/xmu arrays for spline,
	with routine 'sort_xy'.  sort_xy is called in routine spline(),
	and having repeated points causes a warning -- but the fit of 
	the spline works (more or less: still an issue of how 
	iff_spline should deal with the resulting bkg array).	
		
	Also: added iff_test and command '__test' for general testing
	purposes.  

2000-08-21  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0022: relaxed path parameter keywords in feffit

2000-08-21  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0021: fixed errors (serious!) in sum_paths.f
	and fitfun.f for getting Real(chi) and Imag(chi) for fit.
	Also turned back on 'default params' for fft, ff2chi, and 
	feffit commands 
	
2000-08-19  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0020: turned off all 'default params' from 
	program variables in spline, pre_edge, fft, and feffit 
	commands -- trying out __requiring__ all arguments to be
	explicit.
	
2000-08-17  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0019: added 'norm' output to pre-edge
	
2000-08-15  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0018: added 'find_e0' to spline

2000-06-12  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0017: altered iff_color to fix background 
	color selection.

2000-06-04  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0016: altered misc_arr.f again (prenam/fixnam)

2000-06-01  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0015: added 'show' to zoom, fixed 'show' for cursor
	
2000-05-27  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0014: fixed return value for 'end macro' to be 0
	in more situations.

2000-05-21  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0013: fixed bug in 'fixnam' that was allowing
	arrays named '1.x' to be created.  Now munged to '_1.x'

	changed python install procedure to use 'compile.py' and
	'install.py.

2000-05-12  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0012: add 'linestyle' command to set plot
	line style -- analogous to 'color' command.

	rewrote C wrapper:  ifeffitc.c and ifeffit.h are now 
	more complete, and have more C-like interface routines 
	for iff_exec() [ie, ifeffit()], get_scalar(), etc.
	All C/Fortran calling is now confined to ifeffitc.c, 
	allowing all wrapper modules to use the C interfaces
	without dealing with C/Fortran issues.  This was mostly
	done to ease the Windows port, but may also simplify
	porting in general.

2000-05-11  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0011: updated several things in common blocks
	to avoid warnings, changed lm_err() in minpack. Also played 
	with pgplot calls -- having troubles with GrWin on WinNT --
	some pgplot functionality of switching and closing devices
	may be broken.

2000-05-05  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0010: changed array indexing so that the 'magic
	zero array' (ie, array that can be relied on to be full of 
	zeros) is at maxarr, not zero.  Changed indexing of arrays 
	from 0:maxarr to 1:maxarr, and several of the routines that 
	use this. 

2000-04-24  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0009: add '@group' and '@path's to 'erase'
	in iff_erase.f.  Complete rewrite of iff_erase.f, not 
	very well tested, but 'erase @group=x' does work (which
	is what I needed today!).	

2000-04-24  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0008: add 'notitles' option to iff_rddata, 
	and made output $column_label string contain only the
	array _suffixes_.  	
	
2000-04-14  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0007: rewrote iff_print to use buffer
	string before executing echo/chrdmp.  Now works
	from scripting languages when '&screen_echo = 0'.
	
	added sign() function to math parser, which returns
	-1,0,1 based on sign of input.
	
2000-04-11  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0006: fixed bug in iff_show, verified build
	with f2c.  Working of configure/autoconf

2000-04-04  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0005: fixed 'trivial constant' parsing in 
	iff_set, removed one more reference to 'info buffer'.

	python module reworked, now with shell emulator
	
2000-04-03  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0004: removed all references to 'info buffer'
	recovering from vacation, laptop theft.
	
2000-03-11  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 1.0003: added construction of delta_VARS to 
	iff_minimize, and tweaked (of all things!) gaussj.f --
	minpack/fiterr now completely ported to C.

2000-03-07  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.aps.anl.gov>

	* Version 1.0002: now auto-building build.h, with version read
	from this file, and Keyword/Hints read from Keywords.dat.
	Save files upgraded to version 1.01, now recording IFeffit build
	info in save files.
	
	
2000-03-06  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	*  Version 1.0001: Begin using ChangeLog for version numbers
	and update notices, working towards building source configuration
	options into 'build.h'.
